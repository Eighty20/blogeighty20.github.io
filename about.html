<h1>Why we started a blog</h1>

<p>John Tukey once said <i>"The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard"</i>. This is very true within an analytics consultancy, where problems that present themselves sometimes end to soon. What we mean by this statement is, sometimes further exploration into a technique or interesting model is not warranted as the scope of the project does not allow it. This is where a analytics blog comes in. This acts as an incubator for further investigation into techniques which interest our analyst/ data scientists.  </p>

<h1>Who should read this</h1>

<p>Anyone who wants to learn something new, explore techniques or just read about a fun application of a workhorse model. The team consists out of individuals from quantitative fields such as economics, statistics and/or mathematics. This gives a plethora of scope on topics. On here you will find anything from book reviews to useful function which could ease your daily coding life</p>
