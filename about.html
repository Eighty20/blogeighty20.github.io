<h1>Why the name Eighty20?</h1>

<p>Eighty20 Consulting is named after the 80:20 rule. This rule, otherwise known as the Pareto Principle, was first observed by an Italian engineer-turned-economist by the name of Vilfredo Pareto (1848 – 1923). He observed that in his country, 80% of the land was owned by 20% of the population. He also noticed that 20% of the plants in his garden yielded 80% of the produce. Thus was born the 80:20 rule, one which states in its generalised form that 20% of the input generates 80% of the output. It still has multiple applications over 100 years after its discovery. For instance, consultants will tell you that 80% of the insights are yielded by 20% of the analysis. In the CRM field it is widely believed that 20% of the client base generate 80% of company value.</p>
